# Self Evaluation

 ## Functionality
   Meets Expectations
     Enigma encrypt and decrypt methods were implemented succesfully. Additonally I was able to succesfully implement the decrypt/encrypt command line methods.
   
  ## Object Oriented Programming
   Meets Expectations 
    Classes all have a single responsibility and no class has access to information that it should not have. I believe i have kept all objects and classes in appropriate sizes with very straight forward functions/appropriate information access. 
      
  ## Ruby Conventions and Mechanics 
  Meets Expectations 
  Class, method, and variable names follow convention, code is mostly indented correctly. One hash has been implemented in a logical way, and no method is over 10 lines long. Appropriate enumerables have been used
  
  ## Test Driven Development
   Meets Expectations
   Methods are tested at unit and intergration levels, SimpleCov test coverage shows 100& across the board. Edgecases have been addressed and git history shows tests prior to implementation
